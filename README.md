**Â Thousand Network simulation**

This is a small project that I did for the ThousandNetwork application in January 2016. 

Download the ipython notebook to see how to use the simulation code. 

Dependencies:
- python 2.7
- numpy
- matplotlib
- igraph (brew install igraph)
- python-igraph (pip install python-igraph)
